Jedi Sects
----------

Riado School
: A monastic order of Force worshiping martial artist monks, predating the time of Luke Skywalker.
: Though seldom seen the 2000 year old founder Master Riado is still alive and supposed met Luke
shortly after the destruction of the 2nd Death Star.
: Base of operation: The Monastery on the isolate outer rim Planet Riado

Order of the Dragon
: A group of Force wielding warriors focus on connection to the force in all life around them and the direct
elimination of dark-side influence
: Founded by a pair of force sensitive refugees from Alderaan looking to help restore the Sith polluted planet that
would come to be known as new Alderaan
: Base of Operation: The Garrison on New Alderaan

New Republic Guard
: The NRG are tightly tied to the bicameral senate of the New Republic
: The NRG believes it was the arrogance and separation of the Jedi that led to the fall of the Old Republic.
: The NRG act under senate approval, and advise the senate in all matters Force related
: The NRG also allows non-force sensitives to join their ranks in service to the New Republic. These members are expected
to fully participate in all Jedi mental and spiritual rituals and will usually have an at least ceremonial light saber.
: Base of Operation: Coruscant

Hand of Peace
: The most enigmatic sect of Jedi. Hand of Peace Jedi are powerful, yet seldom seen. The lone oldest member of their order
is the only one who attends grand counsel meetings. He always says nothing there only listening
: No other Hand of peace is known. It is said that the others hide among the people of the galaxy or even other Jedi Sects, often posing as wandering Jedi.
However the worst of the citizens of the galaxy fear drawing the attention of the Hands. As it is said they will eliminate them atom by atom until the last.
When you see the symbol of the hand you know your time is short.
: Base of Operation: Unknown

Wandering Jedi
: A diverse group of Jedi who largely pass their training on Master to Padawan one on one.
: Most believe the failings of the Old Republic Jedi came from their reliance on Mass indoctrination and isolation from the common people of the galaxy.
: They believe that Jedi training should be a personal affair between the Master and Padawan. The Master always mindful of the humanity of the padawan. The padawan always mindful of the experience of the Master. Each responsible for the safety Physical and Spiritual of the other. If a Wandering Jedi does fall to the Dark side, their Master or most senior Padawan will usually take it as their duty to bring them back to the light or eliminate them.
: Base of Operation: None, though many would cite the new Jedi temple on Coruscant

Planets & Places
----------------

New Alderaan
: Originally known as Charbon this lush forest planet was corrupted by Sith scientists at Emperor Palaptine's request in order to cultivate beasts that
could be used against his enemies. After the destruction of Alderaan, the refugee's of the planet who happened to be off world at the time decided to choose a new world to colonize as home. After the discovery of the twisted remains of Charbon, they decided it was a prime candidate to show how virtue can overcome the adversity of the dark side.
: The primary settlement has about 500,000 inhabitants, about half of which are descendants of Alderaan.
: The only other permanent settlement on New Alderaan is the Order of the Dragon Garrison. Home to about 1,000 Jedi and Padawans.

Attacked by four of his friends. Take down three, intimidate the last to surrender. He says "Your deaths are inevitable, you will not stop the rise." Then bites down on a drug tooth and dies. Hess tries to track down the initial guy. Can't find a trail.

We enter. Kit climbs up to the rafters and dims the lights. Hess searches and finds the guy. Torei sneaks up, puts a gun in his back and gets him to surrender. He says "I'll tell you everything, just promise not to kill me."

	Who do you work for? I was hired by a human male and zabrak female to keep an eye on that spaceport and scare off anyone who came poking around.

	What else can you tell us about them? They gave me a comm code to tell them if anyone came poking around.
